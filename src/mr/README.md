# MapReduce Framework Implementation

## How It Works
The project involved implementing a distributed MapReduce framework, starting with understanding the codebase and the Google MapReduce paper. The system was architected to have a Coordinator and multiple Workers handling tasks in parallel. The Coordinator assigned tasks and managed the state, while Workers executed mapf and reduce functions.

**Concepts:** MapReduce, Concurrency, Scalability, RPC, Fault Tolerance, Parallel Processing, Distributed Systems
