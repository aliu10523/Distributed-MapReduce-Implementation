MapReduce Framework Implementation

How it Works:
The project involved implementing a distributed MapReduce framework, starting with understanding the codebase and the Google MapReduce paper. The system was architected to have a Coordinator and multiple Workers handling tasks in parallel. The Coordinator assigned tasks and managed the state, while Workers executed mapf and reduce functions. The key was ensuring efficient parallel processing, fault tolerance, and resource synchronization.

Concepts:
MapReduce, Concurrency, Scalability, RPC, Fault Tolerance, Parallel Processing, Distributed Systems
